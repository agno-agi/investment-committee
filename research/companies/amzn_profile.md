# Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)

## Business Overview
Amazon is the world's largest e-commerce company and the leading cloud computing provider through Amazon Web Services (AWS). The company also operates a significant advertising business, Prime subscription service, and is expanding into healthcare, satellite internet (Project Kuiper), and AI services.

## Revenue Segments
- **Online Stores:** Direct e-commerce sales (~40% of revenue).
- **AWS:** Cloud computing platform (~17% of revenue but ~65% of operating income). AWS is the #1 cloud provider by market share.
- **Third-Party Seller Services:** Marketplace fees, fulfillment by Amazon (~24% of revenue).
- **Advertising Services:** Sponsored products, display ads (~8% of revenue). Fastest-growing major segment.
- **Subscription Services:** Prime membership, streaming, Kindle Unlimited.
- **Physical Stores:** Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh, Amazon Go.

## Competitive Position
AWS maintains market leadership in cloud computing with the broadest service portfolio. Amazon's e-commerce logistics network (200+ fulfillment centers, same-day delivery) is nearly impossible to replicate. Prime's 200M+ members create recurring revenue and ecosystem lock-in. The advertising business leverages unique purchase-intent data.

## Growth Drivers
- AWS growth reaccelerating with AI workloads (Bedrock, SageMaker, custom chips)
- Advertising business growing 20%+ with high margins
- Same-day and next-day delivery expanding to more product categories
- Healthcare expansion (Amazon Pharmacy, One Medical)
- Custom AI chips (Trainium, Inferentia) reducing costs vs. NVIDIA GPUs
- Project Kuiper satellite internet (long-term addressable market)

## Key Risks
- AWS growth rate decelerating as competitors (Azure, Google Cloud) gain share
- E-commerce margins remain thin despite logistics optimization
- Massive capex requirements for both fulfillment and cloud infrastructure
- Regulatory scrutiny (FTC antitrust case, labor practices)
- Increasing competition from Walmart, Shopify in e-commerce
- AI custom chip strategy unproven vs. NVIDIA GPU dominance

## Recent Developments
- AWS growth reaccelerated with strong AI demand, backlog reached record highs
- Operating margins expanded significantly through cost discipline
- Advertising segment continues to outpace expectations
- Invested $4B in Anthropic for AI partnership
- Regional fulfillment network redesign improving delivery speed and reducing costs
