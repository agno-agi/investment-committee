# Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)

## Business Overview
Tesla designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage systems, and solar products. The company is also developing autonomous driving technology (Full Self-Driving) and humanoid robots (Optimus). Tesla is the world's most valuable automaker by market capitalization.

## Revenue Segments
- **Automotive:** Electric vehicles (~85% of revenue). Model 3/Y are volume sellers; Cybertruck is the newest addition. Includes regulatory credit sales to other automakers.
- **Energy Generation & Storage:** Megapack (utility-scale batteries), Powerwall (residential), solar panels. Fastest-growing segment by percentage.
- **Services & Other:** Vehicle service, supercharging network, merchandise, insurance.

## Competitive Position
Tesla has brand recognition, manufacturing scale, and a Supercharger network that competitors are now adopting (NACS standard). Its vertically integrated approach (battery manufacturing, software, charging) provides cost advantages. However, competition has intensified significantly from legacy automakers and Chinese EV makers.

## Growth Drivers
- Full Self-Driving (FSD) progress toward Level 4 autonomy (robotaxi potential)
- Energy storage business growing rapidly as utility-scale demand increases
- Next-generation affordable vehicle platform targeting sub-$30K price point
- Optimus humanoid robot program (long-term moonshot)
- Expansion of manufacturing capacity (Gigafactory Mexico, Shanghai expansion)

## Key Risks
- EV competition intensifying: BYD, Hyundai, Ford, GM all gaining share
- Price cuts have pressured margins significantly
- FSD timeline consistently delayed — Level 4 autonomy remains uncertain
- High valuation implies execution on robotaxi/robot narratives, not just car sales
- Elon Musk distraction risk (political involvement, multiple companies)
- Regulatory and political risks across multiple geographies

## Recent Developments
- Vehicle deliveries fell short of expectations amid increased competition
- Automotive gross margins compressed due to price reductions
- Energy storage deployments reached record highs
- FSD v12 launched with end-to-end neural network approach
- Brand perception challenges in some markets due to CEO's political activities
