# Meta Platforms, Inc. (META)

Meta operates the world's largest social media platforms: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. The company also invests heavily in Reality Labs (VR/AR hardware and metaverse). With over 3.2 billion daily active users across its Family of Apps, Meta is the dominant social media advertising platform.
