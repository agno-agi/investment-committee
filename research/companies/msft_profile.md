# Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)

## Business Overview
Microsoft is the world's largest software company, operating across cloud computing, productivity software, gaming, and enterprise services. The company's strategic pivot to cloud (Azure) and early investment in OpenAI have positioned it at the center of the AI revolution.

## Revenue Segments
- **Intelligent Cloud:** Azure cloud platform, SQL Server, Enterprise Services (~40% of revenue). Azure is the second-largest cloud provider behind AWS.
- **Productivity & Business Processes:** Microsoft 365, LinkedIn, Dynamics 365 (~35% of revenue).
- **More Personal Computing:** Windows, Xbox/gaming, Surface, search advertising (~25% of revenue).

## Competitive Position
Microsoft's enterprise relationships are its core moat. Nearly every Fortune 500 company uses Microsoft 365 and/or Azure. The company's $13B investment in OpenAI gives it exclusive access to GPT models, which it integrates across its product suite as "Copilot." GitHub (90M+ developers) provides a developer ecosystem advantage.

## Growth Drivers
- Azure growth accelerating with AI workloads (GPU instances, AI services)
- Microsoft 365 Copilot driving higher per-seat revenue across enterprise
- GitHub Copilot establishing dominance in AI-assisted development
- Gaming segment growing with Activision Blizzard acquisition
- LinkedIn leveraging AI for premium features and advertising

## Key Risks
- Azure growth rate decelerating as base grows larger
- Copilot monetization still unproven at scale — unclear if enterprises will pay $30/user/month
- Capital expenditure on AI infrastructure is massive, ROI timeline uncertain
- Regulatory scrutiny of OpenAI partnership and Activision acquisition
- Competition from AWS and Google Cloud in AI services

## Recent Developments
- Azure revenue growth reaccelerated on AI workload demand
- Microsoft 365 Copilot rolled out to enterprise customers with mixed adoption signals
- Significant capex increase for AI data center infrastructure
- Announced Copilot+ PC initiative with dedicated neural processing units
