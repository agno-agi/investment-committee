# NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)

## Business Overview
NVIDIA designs and manufactures graphics processing units (GPUs) and system-on-chip units. Originally focused on gaming graphics, the company has become the dominant provider of accelerated computing hardware for artificial intelligence training and inference workloads.

## Revenue Segments
- **Data Center:** The largest and fastest-growing segment (~80% of revenue), driven by AI training demand from hyperscalers (Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Amazon AWS) and enterprise customers. Products include H100, H200, and Blackwell GPU architectures.
- **Gaming:** Consumer GPUs (GeForce RTX series) for PC gaming and content creation. Stable but slower-growing compared to data center.
- **Professional Visualization:** Workstation GPUs for design, simulation, and digital twins.
- **Automotive:** DRIVE platform for autonomous vehicles, including partnerships with major automakers.

## Competitive Position
NVIDIA holds an estimated 85%+ market share in AI training GPUs. The CUDA software ecosystem creates significant switching costs — most AI frameworks are optimized for NVIDIA hardware. Competitors include AMD (MI300 series) and custom silicon from Google (TPU), Amazon (Trainium), and Microsoft (Maia), but none have meaningfully eroded NVIDIA's position.

## Growth Drivers
- Enterprise AI adoption is still in early innings — most companies are in pilot phase
- Blackwell architecture (B100/B200) represents the next upgrade cycle
- Sovereign AI initiatives driving government-funded data center buildouts
- AI inference workloads growing faster than training as models deploy to production
- Expansion into networking (InfiniBand, Spectrum-X) for AI cluster connectivity

## Key Risks
- Customer concentration: top 4 hyperscalers represent ~50% of data center revenue
- Export restrictions on advanced chips to China reduce addressable market
- Custom silicon from cloud providers could reduce GPU dependency long-term
- Cyclical risk: AI infrastructure spending could slow if ROI expectations aren't met
- Valuation premium leaves little room for execution missteps

## Recent Developments
- Blackwell GPU architecture launched with record demand, supply-constrained through 2025
- Revenue has grown 100%+ year-over-year for multiple consecutive quarters
- Expanded partnerships with sovereign AI programs in UAE, Saudi Arabia, India
- Jensen Huang positioned NVIDIA as an "AI infrastructure" company, not just a chipmaker
