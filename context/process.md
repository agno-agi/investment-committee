# Investment Process

## Evaluation Pipeline
1. **Market Assessment** — Macro environment and sector outlook
2. **Fundamental Analysis** — Company financials, valuation, growth
3. **Technical Analysis** — Price action, momentum, entry timing
4. **Risk Assessment** — Downside scenarios, position sizing, mandate compliance
5. **Investment Memo** — Formal write-up with recommendation
6. **Committee Decision** — Final vote: BUY / HOLD / PASS with dollar allocation

## Decision Framework
- **BUY:** Strong conviction across fundamentals + technicals, acceptable risk profile
- **HOLD:** Existing position, no action needed at this time
- **PASS:** Insufficient conviction, unacceptable risk, or mandate violation

## Documentation
Every investment decision must be documented in a formal memo that includes:
thesis, market context, financial analysis, technical analysis, risk assessment,
position sizing rationale, and the committee's final decision.
