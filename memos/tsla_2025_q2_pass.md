# Investment Memo: Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)

**Date:** 2025-06-20
**Recommendation:** PASS
**Proposed Allocation:** $0

---

## Investment Thesis

While Tesla remains a leader in the EV transition with significant brand value and manufacturing scale, the current risk/reward profile does not meet our committee's investment criteria. Margin compression from price cuts, intensifying competition, and a valuation that prices in unproven robotaxi and humanoid robot narratives make this a PASS at current levels.

## Market Context

The EV market is experiencing a transition from early-adopter growth to mass-market competition. Legacy automakers (Ford, GM, Hyundai) and Chinese manufacturers (BYD, NIO) are launching competitive EVs at lower price points. Government EV subsidies are being reduced in several markets. The broader auto sector faces cyclical headwinds from higher interest rates affecting consumer financing.

**Market Context Score:** Neutral

## Financial Analysis

- **Revenue Growth:** Decelerating to single digits as price cuts offset volume gains
- **Automotive Gross Margin:** Compressed to ~18% from ~25% two years ago due to aggressive pricing
- **Free Cash Flow:** Positive but declining as capex increases for new factories and projects
- **Valuation:** ~60x forward P/E — implies significant growth from robotaxi/Optimus, not just vehicle sales
- **Analyst Consensus:** Mixed — consensus Hold with wide price target dispersion ($150-$350)
- **Energy Segment:** Growing rapidly but still <10% of revenue

**Fundamentals Rating:** Weak

## Technical Analysis

- Price oscillating around 200-day moving average — no clear trend
- RSI at 48 — neutral territory
- Multiple failed breakout attempts above $250 resistance
- Volume declining on rallies, increasing on sell-offs — bearish divergence
- Support at $180, resistance at $250

**Technical Signal:** Neutral

## Risk Assessment

- **Beta:** 2.1 — significantly above our 1.5 threshold
- **Max Drawdown (12mo):** -40% from peak — exceeds our 20% drawdown tolerance
- **Per Risk Policy:** Beta > 1.5 limits position to 15% ($1.5M), but high drawdown history suggests even smaller allocation would be prudent
- **Key Risk Factors:** EV competition, margin compression, FSD timeline uncertainty, CEO distraction risk, brand perception challenges
- **Downside Scenario:** If EV competition intensifies and FSD fails to deliver, stock could retrace to $120-150 (-40% from current levels)

**Risk Rating:** High

## Position Sizing

Not applicable — PASS recommendation.

Even if we were to invest:
- Beta > 1.5 would limit position to $1.5M maximum
- Historical drawdown of 40% exceeds our 20% tolerance, suggesting exploratory size only ($200K-$500K)
- Risk/reward ratio does not justify any allocation at current valuation

## Committee Decision

**DECISION: PASS**
- **Allocation:** $0
- **Rationale:** The investment does not meet our criteria on multiple dimensions:
  1. **Valuation disconnect:** Current price implies successful robotaxi deployment, which remains unproven
  2. **Margin deterioration:** Automotive margins trending in the wrong direction
  3. **Risk profile:** Beta of 2.1 and -40% max drawdown exceed our comfort level
  4. **Better alternatives:** AI infrastructure plays (NVDA, MSFT) offer superior risk-adjusted returns in the current environment
- **Revisit Conditions:** Reassess if (a) automotive margins stabilize above 20%, (b) FSD achieves Level 4 regulatory approval, or (c) valuation compresses to <40x forward P/E
- **Review Date:** Q3 2025 quarterly review
