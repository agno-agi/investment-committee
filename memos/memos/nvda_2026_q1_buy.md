## 1. Investment Thesis

NVIDIA is the defining infrastructure company of the artificial intelligence era. Its H100/H200 GPU ecosystem — and the forthcoming Blackwell B200/B300 architecture — is the engine powering every major AI training and inference workload across hyperscalers, enterprises, and sovereign AI programs globally. The company's competitive moat is not merely hardware: it is the **CUDA software ecosystem**, now with 7 million developers and decades of optimized libraries, models, and tooling that make switching to competing silicon architecturally costly.

At $187.98, NVDA trades at approximately **25x forward P/E** with revenue growing at 60%+ YoY, gross margins of 73–75%, and operating margins approaching 60%. Data center revenue — the core growth engine — has grown from ~$5B per quarter in early 2024 to an estimated **$30B+ for Q4 FY2026** (reporting February 25, 2026). Sell-side consensus price target of $253.88 implies 35% upside. The stock is entering a confirmed earnings catalyst window with an estimated 85% probability of meeting or exceeding $66B consensus Q4 revenue.

The thesis is straightforward: hyperscaler capex is accelerating — Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon collectively committed **$320B in AI infrastructure spending for 2025** — and NVIDIA captures an estimated 70–80% of that spend. The Blackwell architecture cycle is in its early innings. The 12–18 month revenue runway is visible, contracted, and supply-constrained rather than demand-constrained.

This is a **high-conviction, appropriately sized position** — capped below the beta maximum ($1.5M) to preserve a $500K conditional second tranche for post-earnings deployment on confirmed beat.

---

## 2. Market Context

**Macro Environment:** The AI infrastructure capex supercycle is the dominant macro theme for 2026. Despite near-term technology sector rotation headwinds (Goldman Sachs and Charles Schwab both underweighting technology for H1 2026), hyperscaler capital commitment to AI compute is accelerating, not decelerating. Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon collectively committed $320B in AI capex for 2025, and 2026 guidance from all four is flat-to-higher. This is the direct demand driver for NVIDIA's GPU ecosystem.

**DeepSeek Disruption (Key Risk Context):** The January 2025 DeepSeek shock — which caused NVDA to fall ~35% from $134 to $87 over 8 weeks — established the primary bear thesis: that AI model efficiency improvements could reduce per-query compute demand and undermine GPU demand growth. This risk is real but incomplete. Jensen Huang's **inference scaling counterargument** — more efficient models generate more queries, which drives total compute demand higher — has been validated by hyperscaler behavior: despite DeepSeek, all four major hyperscalers increased 2026 AI capex guidance. The episode demonstrated NVDA's volatility character (beta 2.314) rather than a structural demand break.

**Sector Outlook:** Technology sector at 25% of fund post-NVDA entry (vs. 40% cap). AI infrastructure hardware and software are the highest-conviction subsector within technology. NVIDIA is the primary direct-exposure instrument available in the US large-cap public equity universe.

**Competitive Landscape:** AMD's MI300X is the most credible competing GPU product, with meaningful traction in inference workloads. However, AMD lacks CUDA's software ecosystem depth and is estimated at <15% market share in AI training. Custom ASICs from Google (TPU), Amazon (Trainium), and Microsoft (Maia) represent a medium-term (2027+) risk as they mature for inference-only workloads, but CUDA lock-in limits near-term switching at scale. For the 12–18 month horizon, NVIDIA's competitive position is effectively unassailable.

**Market Context Rating:** Bullish — Accelerating AI capex with near-term earnings catalyst

## 4. Technical Analysis

| Indicator | Reading | Signal |
|---|---|---|
| **Current Price** | $187.98 | Below $212 ATH (Oct 2025); above 50-day MA support |
| **52-Week Range** | $86.49 – $211.93 | Full-cycle recovery from DeepSeek lows |
| **50-Day MA** | ~$175–$180 | Price above — bullish structure |
| **200-Day MA** | ~$140–$145 | Price well above — long-term uptrend intact |
| **All-Time High** | $211.93 (Oct 2025) | 11.3% pullback from ATH; orderly consolidation |
| **RSI** | ~55–60 | Neutral-to-bullish; not overbought |
| **MACD** | Slightly positive | Momentum constructive but not extended |
| **Key Support #1** | $175–$180 (50-day MA) | Primary support zone; Tranche 2 add target |
| **Key Support #2** | $160–$165 | Secondary support; significant buyer interest |
| **Key Support #3** | $141 (200-day MA / mandate exit)** | Hard stop zone |
| **Resistance** | $212 (ATH) | Breakout target on earnings beat |
| **Volume** | Normal — no distribution signals | No institutional selling detected |

### Price Action Context

The stock's 12-month journey is instructive: a **35% DeepSeek-driven collapse** from $134 to $87 (Feb–Apr 2025), followed by a **143% recovery** to the October 2025 ATH of $211.93. The current price of $187.98 represents an orderly **11.3% pullback from ATH** — consistent with normal consolidation ahead of a binary earnings catalyst, not a technical breakdown.

Unlike MSFT, NVDA is trading **above** its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, with no death cross or distribution signals. The technical structure is constructive. The primary risk is the binary nature of the February 25 earnings event.

### Key Historical Moves (Volatility Reference)

| Event | Move | Character |
|---|---|---|
| Feb 2025 DeepSeek week | -11.4% | Systemic shock |
| Apr 2025 capitulation low | -35.1% from Feb peak | Maximum fear |
| Apr 2025 recovery week | +27.6% | Snap-back |
| May 2025 NIM breakout | +10.7% | Catalyst-driven |
| Oct 2025 ATH week | +11.6% | Earnings-driven |
| Post-ATH consolidation | -11.3% | Orderly distribution |

**Technical Signal: 🟡 NEUTRAL-TO-BULLISH — Constructive structure; pre-earnings binary event warrants entry sizing discipline**

## 5. Risk Assessment

**Risk Rating: 🟡 MODERATE — 4.90 / 10**

### Risk Scorecard

| Risk Dimension | Score (1–10) | Weight | Weighted Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Beta / Volatility Risk** | 8 | 25% | 2.00 | Beta 2.314 — highest structural risk factor |
| **Earnings Binary Risk** | 6 | 20% | 1.20 | Feb 25 catalyst; base case positive |
| **Fundamental Risk** | 2 | 15% | 0.30 | Near-perfect balance sheet; minimal |
| **Sector Concentration Risk** | 3 | 10% | 0.30 | 25% Tech post-entry; manageable |
| **Competitive / Moat Risk** | 3 | 10% | 0.30 | CUDA moat durable 12–18 months |
| **Macro / Exogenous Risk** | 5 | 10% | 0.50 | AI capex cycle + rate environment |
| **Mandate Compliance Risk** | 1 | 5% | 0.05 | Full compliance confirmed |
| **Governance Risk** | 5 | 5% | 0.25 | Board risk elevated; founder-led company |
| **TOTAL** | | **100%** | **4.90 / 10** | 🟡 MODERATE |

### Key Risk Factors

**Risk #1 — Beta Amplification (🟠 Medium-High, Structural)**
At beta 2.314, NVDA is the most volatile approved stock in our potential universe. A 1% S&P 500 move generates an expected 2.3% NVDA move. In a broad market selloff (S&P -10%), NVDA's expected move is -23.1%, or -$231K on the $1M position. Mandate caps at $1.5M; our $1M allocation leaves a $500K buffer below the limit.

**Risk #2 — Pre-Earnings Binary Event (🟠 Medium-High, Time-Bounded)**
Q4 FY2026 earnings on February 25, 2026 — 6 days from entry. If Q4 misses $66B OR Q1 FY2027 guidance comes in below $65B, a -15% to -25% price response is historically plausible (-$150K to -$250K on the $1M position). This risk resolves in 6 days and is the primary driver of sizing at $1M rather than the $1.5M beta cap.

**Risk #3 — DeepSeek / Model Efficiency Paradigm (🟡 Medium, Medium-Term)**
AI efficiency improvements could reduce per-query GPU demand. Jensen Huang's inference scaling counterargument is credible but the hyperscaler capex trend is the most reliable data point available. This is a 2027+ concern, not a 12–18 month thesis breaker.

**Risk #4 — Custom ASIC Competition (🟡 Medium, 2027+)**
Google TPU, Amazon Trainium, and Microsoft Maia are maturing for inference-only workloads. Could take 10–20% of addressable inference market by 2027–2028. Near-term impact is minimal given CUDA ecosystem lock-in. Not a 12–18 month concern.

**Risk #5 — China / Export Controls (🟢 Low, Largely Priced In)**
H20 chips are largely restricted. China was ~10–15% of peak revenue, now estimated <5%. Further escalation impact is limited and largely reflected in the current revenue baseline.

**Risk #6 — Key Person / Governance Risk (🟡 Medium, Long-Dated)**
Jensen Huang's vision and execution are deeply embedded in NVDA's culture and roadmap. Governance scores elevated (board independence concerns). Not a 12–18 month concern but a long-term succession risk.

### Drawdown Analysis

| Scenario | NVDA Price | Loss on $1M | % of Fund |
|---|---|---|---|
| Minor pullback (-10%) | $169 | $100K | 1.0% |
| Post-earnings miss (-20%) | $150 | $200K | 2.0% |
| **Mandate exit trigger (-25%)** | **$141** | **$250K** | **2.5%** |
| DeepSeek-style shock (-35%) | $122 | $350K | 3.5% |
| April 2025 repeat (-54%) | $87 | $540K | 5.4% |

> Even in the catastrophic tail scenario (full rerun of Apr 2025 to $87), the $1M position sizing limits total fund damage to 5.4%. The fund is not threatened at any scenario. The mandate exit at $141 caps maximum controlled loss at **$250K (2.5% of fund)**.

### Value at Risk (at $1,000,000 | Annual Volatility ~32.4%)

| VaR Confidence | Horizon | VaR | % of Fund |
|---|---|---|---|
| 95% | 1-Year | $532K | 5.32% |
| 99% | 1-Year | $754K | 7.54% |
| 95% | 3-Month | $266K | 2.66% |
| 99% | 3-Month | $377K | 3.77% |

### Mandate Compliance — Full Check

| Rule | Limit | NVDA at $1M | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Single position cap | 30% ($3M) | 10% ($1M) | ✅ |
| Beta > 1.5 cap | 15% ($1.5M) | 10% ($1M) | ✅ $500K buffer |
| Minimum position size | 2% ($200K) | 10% ($1M) | ✅ |
| Share price | > $5 | $187.98 | ✅ |
| Market cap | > $10B | $4.58T | ✅ |
| US-listed equity | Required | NasdaqGS | ✅ |
| Technology sector cap | 40% ($4M) | 25% ($2.5M) post-entry | ✅ 15% headroom |
| Portfolio beta | ≤ 1.5 | 0.394 (2-stock weighted) | ✅ |
| Cash reserve | ≥ $500K | $7.5M remaining | ✅ |
| Total positions | ≤ 15 | 2 (MSFT + NVDA) | ✅ 13 slots remaining |

**Risk Officer Verdict: ✅ APPROVE — $1,000,000 BUY. Risk is real, quantified, bounded, and proportionate to the return opportunity.**

## 6. Position Sizing

**Recommended Allocation: $1,000,000 (10% of fund)**

### Sizing Rationale

| Methodology | Implied Size | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Beta cap (mandate hard limit) | Max $1.5M (15%) | Beta 2.314 > 1.5 threshold — absolute cap |
| Earnings binary discount | -$500K from cap | 6 days pre-earnings = sizing conservatism |
| Conviction level | High | Strong fundamental + technical case |
| Sector budget | $1.5M headroom | 25% Tech used; $1.5M available to 40% cap |
| Portfolio construction | $1M conservatively | Preserve $500K to add post-earnings |
| **Recommended size** | **$1,000,000 (10%)** | ✅ Optimal across all constraints |

### Why $1,000,000 and Not $1,500,000 (the Beta Cap Maximum)

1. **$500K Conditional Reserve:** Retaining $500K below the $1.5M beta cap creates a **pre-planned second tranche** — not discretionary averaging-down, but a deliberate scale-in mechanism activated only on earnings confirmation.
2. **Earnings Binary Discount:** Entering 6 days before a binary catalyst warrants sizing discipline. The $500K reserve converts to a high-conviction add only if the Feb 25 print validates the thesis.
3. **Portfolio Construction Optionality:** Preserves Tech sector capacity for potential future additions (e.g., a $1.2M position would consume the remaining Tech budget) without approaching the 40% cap prematurely.
4. **Risk-Adjusted Sizing:** Even at $1M, the risk-reward is compelling — consensus upside of +$350K vs. controlled downside of $250K at the mandate exit (1.4:1 minimum).

### Entry Strategy

| Tranche | Size | Entry Target | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tranche 1 (Initial)** | $1,000,000 | $185–$192 (current range) | Execute at market — pre-earnings entry |
| **Tranche 2 (Conditional)** | $500,000 | $175–$180 (50-day MA support) | **Feb 25 earnings beat ONLY** |

> ⚠️ Tranche 2 is NOT activated on a miss, in-line print, or ambiguous guidance. It requires a clear beat on both Q4 revenue ($66B+) and Q1 FY2027 guidance ($67B+).

### Hard Stop Loss

> **$141.00 — Mandatory exit. 25% drawdown from $187.98 entry. No exceptions.**

This aligns with the 200-day moving average zone and represents the boundary of the thesis. A close below $141 on any trading day triggers a full position exit.

## 7. Committee Decision

**DECISION: ✅ BUY — APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Ticker** | NVDA — NVIDIA Corporation |
| **Decision** | ✅ **BUY — APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS** |
| **Initial Allocation** | **$1,000,000 (10% of fund)** |
| **Entry Price** | $187.98 (reference) |
| **Hard Stop Loss** | **$141.00** — mandatory, no discretion |
| **Price Targets** | Base: $240–$255 \| Consensus: $253.88 |
| **Upside** | +28–35% to base / consensus |
| **Risk/Reward** | 1.4:1 minimum at mandate exit; significantly better in base case |
| **Conditional Tranche 2** | $500,000 at $175–$180 **— Feb 25 earnings beat only** |
| **Risk Rating** | 🟡 **MODERATE — 4.90/10** |
| **Tech Sector Post-Entry** | **25% of fund** — $1.5M headroom to 40% cap |
| **Portfolio Beta (2-stock)** | **0.394** — well within 1.5 ceiling |
| **Trim Trigger** | Position value exceeds $3.5M (35% appreciation) |
| **Next Review** | **February 25, 2026 — Q4 FY2026 Earnings** |

### Rationale

NVIDIA's fundamental profile is exceptional by every measurable dimension: 60%+ revenue growth, 73–75% gross margins, ~60% operating margins, a $4.58T market cap reflecting genuine business dominance, and an AI capex supercycle that has at least 2–3 more years of structural tailwinds. The CUDA ecosystem moat is durable within our 12–18 month investment horizon. The sell-side is unanimous — 94% Buy/Strong Buy — at a mean price target of $253.88.

The technical picture is constructive: the stock is above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, with no distribution signals, consolidating 11% below its October 2025 ATH ahead of a known earnings catalyst. This is not a broken stock; it is a high-beta compounder in a normal pre-earnings consolidation pattern.

The risk — specifically, the beta of 2.314 and the binary nature of the February 25 earnings print — is real, quantified, and appropriately managed. The $1M sizing (67% of the $1.5M beta cap) provides bounded downside, a $500K conditional reserve for post-earnings confirmation, and full mandate compliance across all dimensions.

The committee approves this allocation with the following conditions:

1. ✅ **Earnings monitoring (Feb 25):** If Q4 misses $66B OR Q1 FY2027 guidance is below $65B, do NOT add Tranche 2. Reassess position immediately.
2. ✅ **Tranche 2 trigger:** $500K added at $175–$180 (50-day MA) only on a clear earnings beat — Q4 $66B+ and Q1 guide $67B+. This is pre-planned, not reactive.
3. ✅ **Tech sector budget alert:** At 25% post-entry, the committee must explicitly acknowledge remaining capacity before any additional Technology sector positions are added.
4. ✅ **Portfolio beta monitoring:** NVDA contributes 0.231 to weighted portfolio beta per 10% allocation. Track carefully as subsequent positions are added toward the 1.5 ceiling.
5. ✅ **Hard stop enforcement:** $141.00 is absolute. No averaging down. No discretionary overrides.
