# Investment Memo: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)

**Date:** 2025-09-15
**Recommendation:** BUY
**Proposed Allocation:** $1,500,000 (15% of fund)

---

## Investment Thesis

NVIDIA is the dominant platform for AI compute infrastructure, holding 85%+ market share in AI training GPUs. The company's CUDA software ecosystem creates significant switching costs, and the Blackwell architecture represents the next major upgrade cycle. We recommend a BUY at $1.5M, sized below the 30% maximum due to the stock's high beta (>1.5), which triggers our 15% position limit per risk policy.

## Market Context

The AI infrastructure buildout is in early innings. Enterprise AI adoption is transitioning from experimentation to production deployment, driving sustained demand for GPU compute. Sovereign AI initiatives are creating new demand from government-funded data centers globally. The semiconductor sector is in a structural growth phase driven by AI, not a cyclical peak.

**Market Context Score:** Bullish

## Financial Analysis

- **Revenue Growth:** 120%+ year-over-year, driven by data center segment
- **Data Center Revenue:** $28B+ quarterly run rate, representing 80%+ of total revenue
- **Gross Margin:** ~75%, reflecting pricing power and architectural advantage
- **Free Cash Flow:** $28B+ annual run rate, enabling significant R&D reinvestment
- **Valuation:** ~35x forward P/E — premium to semiconductors but justified by growth
- **Analyst Consensus:** Strong Buy, average price target ~$180

**Fundamentals Rating:** Strong

## Technical Analysis

- Price trading above both 50-day and 200-day moving averages
- RSI at 62 — bullish but not overbought (below 70 threshold)
- Recent consolidation near $145 support level provides defined risk
- Volume patterns confirm institutional accumulation
- MACD positive and trending upward

**Technical Signal:** Bullish

## Risk Assessment

- **Beta:** 1.7 — above our 1.5 threshold, triggering reduced position size limit
- **Max Drawdown (12mo):** -28% from peak — within tolerance but warrants monitoring
- **Concentration Risk:** Technology sector currently at 22% of fund; adding $1.5M keeps us within the 40% sector cap
- **Key Risk Factors:** Customer concentration (top 4 hyperscalers = ~50% of data center revenue), China export restrictions, custom silicon competition
- **Downside Scenario:** If AI spending slows, stock could retrace to $100-110 (-25% from entry)

**Risk Rating:** Moderate

## Position Sizing

Per risk policy:
- Beta > 1.5 limits position to 15% of fund ($1.5M) maximum
- Proposed allocation: $1,500,000 (15% of fund)
- This is a high-conviction position at the maximum allowed size for high-beta stocks
- Reserve $500K for potential pullback entry below $145 support

## Committee Decision

**DECISION: BUY**
- **Allocation:** $1,500,000
- **Entry Strategy:** Market order for $1M, limit order at $145 for remaining $500K
- **Stop Loss:** Exit if position declines 25% from average entry price
- **Review Date:** Q4 2025 quarterly review

**Rationale:** Strong fundamentals and secular AI tailwind justify the premium valuation. Position sized at 15% (not the requested $2M) due to high-beta position limit. Technology sector exposure remains within mandate limits at 37% after this allocation.
